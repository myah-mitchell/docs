# Deploying the core infrastructure stack

core-infra is what turns the metrics ci01 already collects into something that reaches you. It is the fourth and last of ci01's stacks.

ntfy is the destination. It takes a push over HTTP and delivers it to a phone or desktop app, and everything else here ends up talking to it.

mailrise is an SMTP server that only speaks ntfy. Proxmox Backup Server and Proxmox VE can send mail and cannot send push notifications, so mailrise takes their mail on the LAN and re-emits it as an ntfy push.

Postfix is the fleet's outgoing mail relay. Services on the LAN hand it their mail with no login, and it passes that mail on to a real mail provider. Mailpit keeps a copy of every message Postfix relays, so you can see exactly what a service sent.

blackbox-exporter probes URLs from outside the service being probed, which is the one thing a metrics agent running next to a service cannot do. uptime-kuma is the glanceable red and green version of the same question.

Read [Conventions](https://github.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/blob/main/docs/conventions.md) first. This doc assumes its naming and secrets rules.

## Prerequisites

- ci01 is provisioned and shows connected and healthy in Komodo, through step 2 of [ci01 bootstrap](index.md). traefik-bootstrap on ci01 is what makes any of these reachable.
- The VictoriaMetrics backend is deployed, through [VictoriaMetrics setup](victoriametrics.md). blackbox-exporter has nothing scraping it until vmagent is there.
- km01's `[[GLOBAL_...]]` Variables exist, from step 14 of [km01 bootstrap](../km01.md).
- Semaphore is running ansible against ci01, through step 12 of [Semaphore setup](semaphore.md). Step 1 runs the `stacks` role from it.
- An account with an SMTP relay for Postfix to send through, such as your mail provider's submission service. Step 3 covers running without one.

## Placeholders

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `<ci-ip>` | ci01's address, the one set in its own runbook |
| `<internal-subnet>` | The internal VLAN in CIDR form, from the same place `<ci-ip>` came from |
| `<ntfy-user>` | The account name you sign in to the ntfy apps with, your choice, created in step 5 |
| `<ntfy-token>` | The publish token printed by step 5 |
| `<relay-host>` | Your SMTP relay's hostname, from the provider |
| `<relay-port>` | That relay's submission port, usually `587` |
| `<relay-user>` | The relay account's username |
| `<test-recipient>` | A mailbox outside the fleet that you can read, for step 8 |

## 1. Create the runtime folders

Neither Periphery nor Compose creates host bind-mount directories, so these have to exist with the right ownership before the first deploy. The ansible `stacks` role creates them from `stacks/core-infra/setup.yaml`, and opens step 2's ports in the same run.

ntfy, uptime-kuma, and Mailpit keep state. Postfix keeps its mail queue there, so mail waiting on an unreachable relay survives a redeploy. mailrise and blackbox-exporter each read one config file that is not in git, so those two directories hold the files rather than the repo checkout does, because Periphery re-clones over its run directory and anything written inside it goes with it.

### Tell ansible which stacks ci01 runs

Add `core-infra` to ci01's `docker_stacks` list in fleet-private's `hosts.yml`, as in [step 10 of Semaphore setup](semaphore.md#add-a-real-host-group-to-fleet-private). Commit and push it.

### Run it

Run the **provision-stacks** Template from [step 12 of Semaphore setup](semaphore.md#create-the-provision-stacks-template) with *Target* answered `ci01`. It creates `/opt/docker/logs/core` and `/opt/docker/volumes/core`, the six service folders inside the volumes one, and the two config files. A config file already on the host is left alone, so running it again never overwrites a filled-in `mailrise.conf`.

Check the result on ci01:

```bash
sudo ls -ln /opt/docker/volumes/core
```

`postfix-data` is owned by `100000`, and the other five folders by `101000`. Postfix runs as the image's own root, which is why it is the exception.

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of ansible</summary>

```bash
projectName="core"

mkdir -p /opt/docker/logs/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/ntfy-data

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/blackbox-exporter-config
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailrise-secrets
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailpit-data
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postfix-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/ntfy-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/uptime-kuma-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/blackbox-exporter-config
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailrise-secrets
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailpit-data
sudo chown 100000:100000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postfix-data
sudo chmod 700 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailrise-secrets
```

Seed both config files from the examples docker-stacks serves publicly, so nothing has to be cloned first:

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL -o /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/blackbox-exporter-config/blackbox.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/main/containers/blackbox-exporter/config/blackbox.yml.example
sudo curl -fsSL -o /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailrise-secrets/mailrise.conf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/main/containers/mailrise/config/mailrise.conf.example
sudo chmod 600 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailrise-secrets/mailrise.conf
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/blackbox-exporter-config/blackbox.yml
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/mailrise-secrets/mailrise.conf
```

</details>

The blackbox copy is usable as it stands. It defines probe modules and nothing host-specific.

The mailrise copy is not, because it carries two `REPLACE_WITH_NTFY_TOKEN` placeholders and the token does not exist until step 5. Leave them for now. mailrise starts and accepts mail with a placeholder token, it just cannot deliver, and the file gets mode `600` because the real token ends up in it.

See [Why 100000 and 101000](../km01.md#why-100000-and-101000) if those owners look arbitrary.

## 2. Open the SMTP ports

mailrise publishes port 8025 on the host and Postfix publishes port 25, because whatever sends to them has to reach them directly rather than through Traefik. Base provisioning enables UFW with a default-deny inbound policy, and step 1's run added a rule for each port. Confirm them on ci01:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Both `8025/tcp` and `25/tcp` show `ALLOW` from `<internal-subnet>`, with the comments `Mailrise SMTP` and `Postfix SMTP`.

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of ansible</summary>

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <internal-subnet> to any port 8025 proto tcp comment 'Mailrise SMTP'
sudo ufw allow from <internal-subnet> to any port 25 proto tcp comment 'Postfix SMTP'
sudo ufw status
```

</details>

Both rules are scoped to the internal subnet. Neither service asks for a login: mailrise accepts anything that arrives, and Postfix relays for any private address. That is fine for a LAN-only relay and not fine for anything wider.

The other four services are reached through Traefik on 443, already open from traefik-bootstrap.

## 3. Create the Stack resource

In Komodo's UI, go to *Resources > Stacks*, create a Stack named `core-infra`, and set its target *Server* to **ci01**.

### Point it at the repo

Under *Choose Mode*, choose **Git Repo**.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Repo* | `myah-mitchell/docker-stacks` |
| *Branch* | `main` |
| *Run Directory* | `stacks/core-infra` |
| *File Path* | `compose.yaml`, relative to the run directory |

The repo is public, so Komodo needs no credential to clone it.

### Paste the environment

*Environment* is a plain text editor with no option to point at a file. Open `stacks/core-infra/komodo.env` in docker-stacks, copy its full contents, and paste them into that field.

Four keys in the pasted text need a value from you:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVER_NAME` | `ci01` |
| `SUB_DOMAIN_NAME` | This site, with the trailing dot, so `home.` |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | The real domain, `myah-mitchell.com` |
| `TRAEFIK_AUTH_CHAIN` | `chain-no-auth@file`, so it routes through traefik-bootstrap |

blackbox-exporter, uptime-kuma, and Mailpit all fall back to `chain-authentik@file`, which still has nothing behind it, hence the override. Clear it once id01 is live. ntfy is hardcoded to `chain-no-auth@file` and ignores the setting, because publishers authenticate to ntfy itself rather than through a browser sign-in.

Leave every `[[GLOBAL_...]]` reference exactly as it is.

### Choose where Postfix sends mail

Postfix needs somewhere to hand mail on to. Set these three keys for your relay:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST` | `[<relay-host>]:<relay-port>` |
| `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST_USERNAME` | `<relay-user>` |
| `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST_PASSWORD` | Leave as the pasted `[[POSTFIX_RELAYHOST_PASSWORD]]` |

Then go to *Settings > Secrets* and create `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST_PASSWORD`, with the relay account's password as its value.

Keep the square brackets. They tell Postfix to connect to that host directly instead of looking up MX records for it.

`POSTFIX_ALLOWED_SENDER_DOMAINS` is blank, which means `DOMAIN_NAME`. Postfix relays only mail whose From address is in that domain, matched exactly. To send from other domains or a sub-domain, list every one of them, separated by spaces.

If you have no relay yet, leave `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST` and `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST_USERNAME` blank and clear `POSTFIX_RELAYHOST_PASSWORD` to blank as well. Postfix then delivers straight to each recipient's mail server, and most providers junk or refuse mail sent that way from a home address. Mailpit still gets its copy, so the relay is useful for debugging until you add a real one.

### Deploy

Save the Stack resource, then click **Deploy**.

All six services should come up. The two config files were put in place in step 1, so there is nothing to fix up afterwards and nothing to redeploy for.

## 4. Verify

Confirm all six services show running and healthy, in Komodo's container view for the resource:

```text
ntfy
mailrise
postfix
mailpit
blackbox-exporter
uptime-kuma
```

mailrise starts after ntfy is healthy, so a stuck mailrise usually means ntfy is the real problem.

## 5. Create the ntfy accounts

ntfy deploys with `NTFY_AUTH_DEFAULT_ACCESS` set to `deny-all`, so nothing can publish or subscribe until you say so. Nothing is broken; it is waiting.

Make your own account first, which is the one you sign in to from the phone and desktop apps:

```bash
docker exec -it core-ntfy ntfy user add --role=admin <ntfy-user>
```

Then make a second account that can only publish, and only to the alert topics:

```bash
docker exec -it core-ntfy ntfy user add --role=user publisher
docker exec -it core-ntfy ntfy access publisher 'alerts-*' write-only
docker exec -it core-ntfy ntfy token add publisher
```

Keep the token that last command prints. Everything that sends alerts uses it, and handing out a write-only token is a good deal narrower than handing out your admin password.

Store it in Vaultwarden. It is the same token step 6 needs and the same one Alertmanager will need later.

## 6. Finish mailrise and point Proxmox at it

Replace both `REPLACE_WITH_NTFY_TOKEN` placeholders in the config seeded in step 1 with the token from step 5:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/REPLACE_WITH_NTFY_TOKEN/<ntfy-token>/g' \
        /opt/docker/volumes/core/mailrise-secrets/mailrise.conf
```

Restart mailrise from Komodo so it reads the file again.

mailrise routes on the recipient address. A config key with no domain, like `backups`, matches only `backups@mailrise.xyz`, mailrise's own placeholder domain, and mail to any other domain is refused. The domain is never looked up: Proxmox hands the message straight to mailrise on port 8025, so nothing leaves the LAN.

| Mail addressed to | Pushed to topic |
| --- | --- |
| `backups@mailrise.xyz` | `alerts-backups` |
| `infra@mailrise.xyz` | `alerts-infra` |

In both Proxmox VE and Proxmox Backup Server, under *Datacenter > Notifications*, add an SMTP target:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Endpoint Name* | `mail-to-ntfy` |
| *Server* | `<ci-ip>` |
| *Port* | `8025` |
| *Encryption* | None |
| *Authenticate* | Off |
| *From Address* | `pve@mailrise.xyz` on Proxmox VE, `pbs@mailrise.xyz` on Proxmox Backup Server |
| *Additional Recipient(s)* | `backups@mailrise.xyz` |

The from address plays no part in routing. It still matters, because mailrise titles each push `$subject ($from)` by default, so the from address is what tells a PVE alert apart from a PBS one on the lock screen.

> [!WARNING]
> Keep the previous mail target as a second notification target for a couple of weeks rather than cutting straight over. A mistake in this path means no notifications at all, which is worse than the notifications-in-spam problem it replaces.

### Check delivery from an admin machine

The ntfy phone apps cannot connect yet. At this point in the running order nothing has published a DNS record for ntfy, and traefik-bootstrap serves a self-signed certificate that the apps refuse. Subscribing a phone waits until [after the Traefik handover](#after-the-traefik-handover-subscribe-your-phone).

Watch the topic from an admin machine instead, forcing the hostname to ci01's address:

```bash
curl -sk -u <ntfy-user> \
  --resolve ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com:443:<ci-ip> \
  https://ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com/alerts-backups/json
```

Substitute whatever `SUB_DOMAIN_NAME` and `DOMAIN_NAME` you actually set. curl prompts for the password, then prints one `"event":"open"` line and waits. Your admin account from step 5 can read every topic, so this needs no access rule.

In Proxmox, select the new target and click **Test**. A line with `"event":"message"` and `"topic":"alerts-backups"` arriving in that terminal proves the whole Proxmox, mailrise, ntfy path. Repeat from the other Proxmox host.

## 7. First access to Uptime Kuma

Browse to `https://uptime-kuma.ci01.home.myah-mitchell.com`, substituting whatever `SUB_DOMAIN_NAME` and `DOMAIN_NAME` you actually set. Your browser will warn about the certificate, because traefik-bootstrap signs its own. Accept it and continue.

There are no default credentials. The first visit prompts you to create the admin account.

### Add the ntfy notification

Uptime Kuma is the status page, not the alerting engine, but its down and up events should still land in the same place as everything else. Set the notification up now, before any monitor exists, so every monitor you add later picks it up automatically.

Go to *Settings > Notifications* and click **Setup Notification**. Fill in the dialog:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Notification Type* | `ntfy` |
| *Friendly Name* | `ntfy alerts-infra` |
| *ntfy Topic* | `alerts-infra` |
| *Server URL* | `http://ntfy` |
| *Priority* | `3` |
| *Authentication Method* | Access Token |
| *Access Token* | `<ntfy-token>`, the publisher token from step 5 |
| *Icon URL* | Leave blank |
| *Default enabled* | Ticked |
| *Apply on all existing monitors* | Leave unticked, there are none yet |

A few of those are less obvious than they look.

*Server URL* is ntfy's own container name over the `backend` network the two share, in plain HTTP. The request never passes through Traefik, so the self-signed certificate does not matter. Leave the topic out of it: Uptime Kuma posts JSON to the server root and names the topic inside the body, and the form warns if the URL contains one.

*Access Token* rather than your admin login. The publisher token can only write, and only to `alerts-*`, so it is the narrower credential to leave stored in another application's database.

*Priority* is not applied evenly. Uptime Kuma sends every event at the number you set, except *DOWN* events, which it sends one higher. The form pre-fills `5`, which sends everything at ntfy's maximum, recoveries included. `3` sends recoveries at ntfy's default priority and outages at `4`, high, so the two are distinguishable at a glance.

*Default enabled* pre-selects this notification on every monitor created from now on. If you ever add monitors before this, tick *Apply on all existing monitors* instead to attach it to those as well.

### Test it

Start the same watch as step 6, pointed at this topic:

```bash
curl -sk -u <ntfy-user> \
  --resolve ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com:443:<ci-ip> \
  https://ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com/alerts-infra/json
```

Click **Test** in the dialog. Uptime Kuma should report *Sent Successfully.*, and the terminal should print a message titled `alerts-infra [Uptime-Kuma]` with the `test_tube` tag.

If the test fails instead:

| Error | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `forbidden` with code `40301` | The token is missing or wrong, or the topic is outside `alerts-*`. ntfy's `deny-all` default refuses anything unauthenticated |
| `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND ntfy` | Uptime Kuma is not on the `backend` network, so the name `ntfy` does not resolve |

Once the test lands, click **Save**.

Real events look different from the test. A monitor going down arrives titled `<monitor> Down [Uptime-Kuma]` with a red circle, the check's error as the message, and an `Open <monitor>` button linking to the monitored URL. Recovery arrives as `<monitor> Up [Uptime-Kuma]` with a green circle.

## 8. Send a test message through Postfix

This proves the whole path a service's mail takes: the port, the firewall, the sender check, the relay, and the copy to Mailpit.

From an admin machine on the internal subnet, write a short message. The From address has to be in `DOMAIN_NAME`:

```bash
printf 'From: test@myah-mitchell.com\r\nTo: <test-recipient>\r\nSubject: core-infra test\r\n\r\nSent through Postfix on ci01.\r\n' > core-infra-test.eml
```

Send it to ci01 with curl, which speaks SMTP:

```bash
curl --url smtp://<ci-ip>:25 \
  --mail-from test@myah-mitchell.com \
  --mail-rcpt <test-recipient> \
  --upload-file core-infra-test.eml
```

curl prints nothing when Postfix accepts the message. If it reports an error instead, run it again with `-v` to see Postfix's reply.

### Check the copy and the delivery

Browse to `https://mailpit.ci01.home.myah-mitchell.com`, substituting whatever `SUB_DOMAIN_NAME` and `DOMAIN_NAME` you actually set. Accept the certificate warning, as in step 7. The test message should be at the top of the inbox.

Then check what happened to the original, on ci01:

```bash
docker logs core-postfix 2>&1 | grep 'status='
```

Expect two lines for the message, both with `status=sent`. One shows `relay=mailpit` for the copy, and the other names your relay. Finally, confirm the message reached `<test-recipient>`, checking its spam folder too.

If it failed:

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| curl times out connecting | Port 25 is not open from your address. Check step 2 |
| `Client host rejected: Access denied` | You are sending from an address outside the private ranges Postfix relays for |
| `Recipient address rejected: Access denied` | The From domain is not in `POSTFIX_ALLOWED_SENDER_DOMAINS`. Postfix reports a failed sender check against the recipient |
| `status=deferred` with `SASL authentication failed` | The relay username or password is wrong |
| `status=bounced` with a reply from the relay | The relay refused the sender. Most relays only send for domains set up on your account there |

Delete `core-infra-test.eml` once it works.

## After the Traefik handover: subscribe your phone

Come back to this once ci01 runs both [system-agent](../../shared-stacks/system-agent.md) and [traefik-agent](../../shared-stacks/traefik-agent.md). The first publishes a DNS record for ntfy through dockns, and the second replaces traefik-bootstrap's self-signed certificate.

Before starting, open `https://ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com` in the phone's browser and confirm it loads without a certificate warning. The apps refuse any certificate the browser would warn about.

On Android:

1. Go to *Settings > Manage users > Add user*, with server `https://ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com` and the `<ntfy-user>` credentials from step 5.
2. Tap **+**, enter topic `alerts-backups`, tick *Use another server*, enter the same server URL, and subscribe.
3. Repeat step 2 for `alerts-infra`.

On iOS:

1. In *Settings*, set the default server to `https://ntfy.home.myah-mitchell.com` and add the same user.
2. Tap **+** and subscribe to `alerts-backups` and `alerts-infra`.
3. Add `NTFY_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL: "https://ntfy.sh"` to ntfy's environment and redeploy core-infra. iOS only delivers background notifications through Apple's push service, and only ntfy.sh can reach it, so without this line nothing arrives while the app is closed. ntfy.sh receives a wake-up with no message content; the app then fetches the message from your server.

Send another **Test** from Proxmox and confirm it arrives on the phone with the app closed.

## What's next

ci01 is finished. It runs Semaphore, the VictoriaMetrics backend, and the notification, mail relay, and uptime services, and every VM built after this one reports to it from its first deploy.

blackbox-exporter is deployed but nothing probes anything yet. It is a multi-target proxy, so it needs a vmagent scrape job that rewrites each target into a `/probe` query parameter, and a vmalert rule on `probe_success` to notify through ntfy. The [generated README for core-infra](https://github.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/blob/main/stacks/core-infra/README.md) has the scrape job to copy. Both belong with the rest of the alerting work rather than here.

id01 is the next VM, in [id01 bootstrap](../id01.md). Its email settings point at the Postfix relay you tested in step 8. See [Running order](../../index.md#running-order) for the rest.
