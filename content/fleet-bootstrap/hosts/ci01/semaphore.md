# Deploying Semaphore and wiring it to ansible

Semaphore is the second of ci01's four stacks, and the first one meant to stay. This doc takes it from an empty host to a Template that runs against the fleet: runtime folders, the Komodo Stack resource, then a Project, an SSH credential, the ansible repo, a real inventory, and the private variables.

A Semaphore that is up but unwired is worth nothing, so there is no useful place to stop partway.

This is the point of building ci01 before anything else. Until Semaphore can reach the fleet, every shared secret in ansible has to be fixed by hand, host by host, over SSH.

## The problem this solves

Cloud-init runs ansible once, on a host's first boot, from whatever the repo held that day.

After that the host is on its own. A role that gains a task, a shared credential that changes, a setting corrected across the fleet: none of it reaches a host that is already built. Fixing one host means an SSH session, and fixing all of them means a dozen.

Semaphore is what re-runs ansible against hosts that already exist. It holds the fleet's SSH key and an inventory carrying the identity values from fleet-private, so a change lands everywhere by running one Template rather than by hand.

Every host after ci01 is built with it in place, so it never has to be retrofitted onto them.

## Prerequisites

- ci01 is provisioned and shows connected and healthy in Komodo, through step 2 of [ci01 bootstrap](index.md). Step 2 in particular: without traefik-bootstrap there is no way to reach Semaphore's UI once it deploys.
- km01's `[[GLOBAL_...]]` Variables exist, from step 14 of [km01 bootstrap](../km01.md). Step 3 below fails without them.
- You have fleet-private checked out somewhere you can commit and push from.
- You know the four identity values the fleet was provisioned with, listed under [Placeholders](#placeholders).

## Placeholders

| Placeholder | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `<km-ip>` | km01's address, from its own runbook |
| `<ci-ip>` | ci01's address, from its own runbook |
| `<internal-subnet>` | The internal VLAN's CIDR, the one every fleet VM but bh01 and mx01 sits on |
| `<short_name>` | Fleet identity value, the organisation short name |
| `<abbr_name>` | Fleet identity value, its abbreviation |
| `<location_abbr>` | Fleet identity value, the site letter |
| `<domain_name>` | Fleet identity value, the real domain |
| `<same>` | The value that host was already provisioned with, recovered rather than guessed |

## 1. Create the runtime folders

The ansible `stacks` role creates these from `stacks/semaphore-server/setup.yaml`. Semaphore is what later runs that role for every host, so this once, run it on ci01 itself. Follow [Run the stacks role without Semaphore](../../procedures/provision-a-vm.md#run-the-stacks-role-without-semaphore) with `<stack>` set to `semaphore-server`.

Check the result:

```bash
sudo ls -ln /opt/docker/volumes/semaphore
```

The three `semaphore-` folders are owned by `101001`, and `postgres-data`, `postgres-backup-data` and `postgres-initdb` by `100000`. `postgres-initdb` holds one script, `10-tofu-state.sh`.

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of ansible</summary>

On ci01, as the user Periphery runs as:

```bash
projectName="semaphore"

mkdir -p /opt/docker/logs/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/semaphore-data
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/semaphore-config
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/semaphore-tmp
sudo chown 101001:101001 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/semaphore-*

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postgres-data
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postgres-backup-data
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postgres-initdb
sudo chown 100000:100000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postgres-*
sudo chmod 755 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/postgres-initdb
```

Copy `containers/semaphore/config/postgres-initdb/10-tofu-state.sh` from docker-stacks into `postgres-initdb`, owned by `100000:100000` with mode `755`. The generated README has the exact commands.

This list mirrors the [generated README for semaphore-server](https://github.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/blob/main/stacks/semaphore-server/README.md), which `scripts/build.py` rebuilds. That file wins if the two disagree.

</details>

See [Why 100000 and 101000](../km01.md#why-100000-and-101000) if those owners look arbitrary. Semaphore is hardwired to use user 1001 so we use 101001 for that container.

Unlike km01, you do not clone docker-stacks onto ci01 yourself. Periphery clones it into `/opt/docker/stacks/<stack-name>/` the first time you point a Stack resource at it, a separate clone per Stack rather than one checkout they share. `/opt/docker/repos/` stays empty: that is for standalone Repo resources, and docker-stacks is never registered as one. The folders above still have to exist with the right ownership before that first deploy, because neither Periphery nor Compose creates host bind-mount directories. These are Semaphore's. The other stack on ci01 has its own set, in step 3 of [VictoriaMetrics setup](victoriametrics.md).

## 2. Generate Semaphore's three encryption keys

Three of Semaphore's values are base64-encoded 32-byte keys rather than plain passwords, so `scripts/build.py` deliberately does not generate them. Generate them once, now:

```bash
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64  # SEMAPHORE_COOKIE_HASH
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64  # SEMAPHORE_COOKIE_ENCRYPTION
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64  # SEMAPHORE_ACCESS_KEY_ENCRYPTION
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These three must stay stable across restarts. Rotating any of them invalidates every stored SSH key, every stored vault secret, and every active session.

They go into Komodo Secrets in step 3, not into any file in docker-stacks.

## 3. Create the Stack resource for semaphore-server

In Komodo's UI, go to *Resources > Stacks* and create a new Stack named `semaphore-server`. Set its target *Server* to **ci01**, the resource created by [step 5 of Provisioning a VM](../../procedures/provision-a-vm.md#5-give-the-host-an-onboarding-key).

### Point it at the repo

Under *Choose Mode*, choose **Git Repo**.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Repo* | `myah-mitchell/docker-stacks` |
| *Branch* | `main` |
| *Run Directory* | `stacks/semaphore-server` |
| *File Path* | `compose.yaml`, relative to the run directory |

The repo is public, so Komodo needs no credential to clone it.

### Paste the environment

*Environment* is a plain text editor with no option to point at a file. Open `stacks/semaphore-server/komodo.env` in docker-stacks, copy its full contents, and paste them into that field.

Four keys in the pasted text need a value from you:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVER_NAME` | `ci01` |
| `SUB_DOMAIN_NAME` | This site, with the trailing dot, so `home.` |
| `DOMAIN_NAME` | The real domain, `myah-mitchell.com` |
| `TRAEFIK_AUTH_CHAIN` | `chain-no-auth@file`, so it routes through traefik-bootstrap |

Authentik does not exist yet, so the real `chain-authentik@file` default has nothing behind it. Clear that override later, in [step 6 of traefik-agent](../../shared-stacks/traefik-agent.md#6-tear-down-traefik-bootstrap), once that stack has replaced traefik-bootstrap here.

Three more keys are blank and stay that way: `POSTGRES_BACKUP_DB`, `POSTGRES_BACKUP_USER`, and `POSTGRES_BACKUP_PASSWORD`. This stack's `compose.yaml` points all three at the same database, user, and password its own Postgres service already resolves.

Leave every `[[...]]` reference in the pasted text exactly as it is. Komodo resolves them at deploy time from its own Variables and Secrets, which is the next step.

### Create the ten Semaphore Secrets

The `[[GLOBAL_...]]` references already resolve, from km01's step 14. The `[[SEMAPHORE_...]]` ones do not exist yet.

Go to *Settings > Secrets* on km01 and create all ten by name. These are real credentials, so Secrets rather than Variables: Komodo resolves both identically, but Secrets stay masked in the UI.

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_USER` | Your choice |
| `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_NAME` | Your choice |
| `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Your choice |
| `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Your choice, alphanumeric only |
| `SEMAPHORE_COOKIE_HASH` | First value from step 2 |
| `SEMAPHORE_COOKIE_ENCRYPTION` | Second value from step 2 |
| `SEMAPHORE_ACCESS_KEY_ENCRYPTION` | Third value from step 2 |
| `SEMAPHORE_POSTGRES_USER` | Your choice |
| `SEMAPHORE_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Your choice, alphanumeric only |
| `SEMAPHORE_TOFU_STATE_PASSWORD` | Your choice, alphanumeric only. The `tofu` role's password for the OpenTofu state database, see [the OpenTofu state database](#the-opentofu-state-database) |

The last two feed the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` lines in the pasted text. Do not edit those two lines themselves.

The alphanumeric-only rule matters here for the same reason it does everywhere else. See [Conventions](https://github.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/blob/main/docs/conventions.md#alphanumeric-only).

Deploying before all ten exist fails the same way a missing `GLOBAL_*` does, with Compose trying to interpolate the literal string `[[SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD]]` into the container's environment. Create the Secrets and click **Deploy** again.

### Deploy

Save the Stack resource, then click **Deploy**. Watch the deploy log. Komodo clones the repo onto ci01, reads the compose file, and runs the equivalent of `docker compose up -d` through Periphery.

## 4. Verify

Confirm all three services show running and healthy, in Komodo's container view for the resource:

```text
semaphore
postgres
postgres-backup
```

To check from the host instead, SSH to ci01 and run `docker compose ps` in `/opt/docker/stacks/semaphore-server/stacks/semaphore-server`, the run directory inside Periphery's clone for this Stack.

## 5. First access

Browse to `https://semaphore.ci01.home.myah-mitchell.com`, substituting whatever `SUB_DOMAIN_NAME` and `DOMAIN_NAME` you actually set. This is real Traefik routing, through the traefik-bootstrap deployed in [step 2 of the ci01 runbook](index.md#2-deploy-traefik-bootstrap-onto-ci01).

Your browser will warn about the certificate. That is expected: it is self-signed, not issued by a CA your browser trusts. Accept it and continue.

Log in with the `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_USER` and `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in step 3.

If the page does not load at all, the likeliest causes are ci01's traefik-bootstrap not actually healthy, or `TRAEFIK_AUTH_CHAIN` not overridden in step 3. See [Traefik bootstrap](../../shared-stacks/traefik-bootstrap.md).

## 6. Create the bootstrap SSH key

Semaphore reaches every host as the `ansible` service account. The users role creates it with `NOPASSWD: ALL` sudo and an `authorized_keys` file built from `ansible_ssh_public_keys`.

Generate the keypair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "semaphore-bootstrap" -f ./semaphore-bootstrap -N ""
```

Add the public half, `semaphore-bootstrap.pub`, to fleet-private's `group_vars/all/private.yml` under `ansible_ssh_public_keys`. That is a list, so append rather than replace. Commit and push.

Hosts provisioned after this point pick the key up automatically on first boot. Hosts that already exist do not, and Semaphore cannot fix that yet because it has no way in. Break the loop by hand, once per existing host, over SSH:

```bash
cd /tmp/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml -c local provision.yml \
  -e '{"target":"ubuntu_docker","server_password":"","short_name":"<same>","abbr_name":"<same>","location_abbr":"<same>","domain_name":"<same>"}' \
  --tags users
```

Use the same argument-recovery trick from [Provisioning a VM](../../procedures/provision-a-vm.md#recover-the-original-provisioning-arguments) if you do not know the four values for that host.

If `/tmp/ansible` or `/tmp/fleet-private` is gone on a host, clone it again first, the same way [step 5 of Provisioning a VM](../../procedures/provision-a-vm.md#5-give-the-host-an-onboarding-key) does.

Do this on km01 and ci01 at minimum. This static key is the same kind of bootstrap exception as Komodo's own manual first start, and [step 13](#13-replace-this-key-once-step-ca-is-live) replaces it later.

## 7. Create the Project

In Semaphore, create a Project named `fleet-provisioning`.

A Semaphore Project is the top-level container: Key Store, Repositories, Inventory, Variable Groups, and Templates all live inside one.

Do not name it `ansible`. Three things one level down inside it are already called `ansible`: the Repository in step 9, the service account it connects as, and the key credential in step 8.

## 8. Add the SSH key to the Key Store

Go to *Key Store* and click **New Key**.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `ansible-bootstrap-key` |
| *Type* | **SSH Key** |
| *Username* | `ansible` |
| *Private Key* | The contents of `semaphore-bootstrap`, the private half from step 6 |

The *Username* field here is what becomes `ansible_user` on every connection, so the inventory in step 10 does not need to set it.

Add a second entry for the private repo, which Semaphore clones to read the inventory in step 10:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `fleet-private-read` |
| *Type* | **Login with password** |
| *Login* | Your GitHub username |
| *Password* | A fine-grained PAT with read-only *Contents* access to fleet-private alone |

The same PAT can be the `ansible_private_repo_token` in step 11, since both only read that one repo.

## 9. Add the ansible repository

Go to *Repository* and click **New Repository**.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `ansible` |
| *URL* | `https://github.com/myah-mitchell/ansible` |
| *Branch* | `main` |
| *Access Key* | **None** |

The ansible repo is public, so no deploy key is needed, the same as the docker-stacks Stack resource in Komodo.

Create a second Repository for the private repo:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `fleet-private` |
| *URL* | `https://github.com/myah-mitchell/fleet-private` |
| *Branch* | `main` |
| *Access Key* | **fleet-private-read** from step 8 |

The dotfiles repo needs no Repository entry at all. Its own Ansible role clones it directly over plain HTTPS.

## 10. Create the inventory

This is the step with real work in it. The `hosts.yml` in both ansible and fleet-private is built for local runs. Its localhosts group holds three entries, ubuntu, ubuntu_docker, and wsl, and points all of them at 127.0.0.1, because every Docker VM so far was provisioned by cloud-init with `-c local`.

Semaphore connects over SSH from ci01. Pointed at `ubuntu_docker`, it would run against `127.0.0.1`, which is ci01 itself, every time. There is no group in the shipped inventory that names a real remote Docker host.

So the fleet's real Docker hosts have to be added as new entries. They do not exist yet in any file.

### Add a real host group to fleet-private

Open fleet-private's `hosts.yml` and edit the `docker_host` group alongside the existing `pve_host` and `pbs_host` ones.

```yaml
docker_host:
  hosts:
    km01:
      ansible_host: <km-ip>
      serverHostname: "km01"
      docker_stacks:
        - system-agent
        - traefik-agent
        - komodo-server
    ci01:
      ansible_host: <ci-ip>
      serverHostname: "ci01"
      docker_stacks:
        - system-agent
        - traefik-agent
        - semaphore-server
  vars:
    docker_stacks_internal_subnet: "<internal-subnet>"

    ntp_service: "chrony"

    FIREWALL: true
    firewall_service: "ufw"

    SWAP: true
    swap_size: "512M"
    swap_file: "/swapfile"

    AUTOUPDATE: true
    DOCKER: true
    KOMODO: true
    NODE_EXPORTER: true
```

Those uppercase flags are what gate each role in `provision.yml`. They are copied from the shipped `ubuntu_docker` entry, but hoisted into a group-level `vars:` block so every host added later inherits them instead of repeating the list.

`serverHostname` is optional. It falls back to the live `ansible_facts.hostname`, but pinning it documents intent and is what `komodo_connect_as` keys off.

Do not set `ansible_user` here. Step 3's Key Store entry supplies it.

`docker_stacks` lists the stacks each host runs once the site is finished, by their directory names under docker-stacks' `stacks/` rather than their Komodo Stack names. The `stacks` role reads it, and scopes firewall rules for fleet-only ports to `docker_stacks_internal_subnet`.

Writing the finished list this early is safe because of `docker_stacks_bootstrap`, set on the host here while the fleet is being built:

```yaml
    ci01:
      ansible_host: <ci-ip>
      serverHostname: "ci01"
      docker_stacks_bootstrap: true
      docker_stacks:
        ...
```

 Each stack in docker-stacks carries the services it still needs from elsewhere in the fleet, rolled up from the containers it runs. system-agent does, since its vmagent writes through the VictoriaMetrics backends, and so does traefik-agent, whose traefik-kop writes into tf01's Redis. A host with it set leaves those stacks out, and gets traefik-bootstrap in their place when something still needs a Traefik and nothing left provides one. Once tf01, id01, and pk01 are live, remove the line and the same list gives the host its real stacks. It stays in the inventory rather than being answered per run, because [one-run provisioning](../../procedures/one-run-provisioning.md) writes each host's Komodo Stacks from the inventory and commits them, and both need to agree.

Each later runbook adds its own stack to a host's list before running the Template from [step 12](#create-the-provision-stacks-template).

Add each new VM to this group as you build it. tf01, id01, pk01, and the rest all belong here.

Commit and push fleet-private.

### Load it into Semaphore

Go to *Inventory* and click **New Inventory**.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `ansible-fleet` |
| *Type* | **File** |
| *Repository* | **fleet-private** from step 9 |
| *Path* | `hosts.yml` |
| *User Credentials* | **ansible-bootstrap-key** from step 8 |

Semaphore clones fleet-private for each run and reads `hosts.yml` from it, so a pushed change applies to the next run with nothing to paste. Ansible also loads the `group_vars/` folder next to that file, so `group_vars/all/private.yml` applies to every host without being copied anywhere. The roles that `site.yml` adds find their files there too: `opentofu/prod.tfvars` and `komodo/stacks/`.

## 11. Create the fleet-private Variable Group

Go to *Variable Groups*, click **New Group**, and name it `fleet-private`.

### Which of the four fields to use

The Variable Group has two tabs, *Variables* and *Secrets*, and each tab is split into two sections. Four boxes, and only two of them do anything useful here.

| Section | What it does | Use it? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Variables* tab, *Extra Variables* | Passed as `--extra-vars`. Real Ansible variables | Yes, for everything non-sensitive |
| *Secrets* tab, *Extra Variables* | Passed as `--extra-vars`, masked in the UI and logs | Yes, for credentials |
| *Variables* tab, *Environment Variables* | Set as OS environment variables on the `ansible-playbook` process | No |
| *Secrets* tab, *Environment Variables* | Same, masked | No |

Ansible never sees an OS environment variable as a Jinja variable unless a role explicitly calls `lookup('env', ...)`, and none of `provision.yml`'s roles do. Anything put in an *Environment Variables* section is silently ignored: the run does not error, it just keeps using each role's own defaults as though you set nothing.

Leave both *Environment Variables* sections empty for `provision.yml`. [One-run provisioning](../../procedures/one-run-provisioning.md#5-add-the-secrets-to-semaphore) adds some there later, for the roles of its own that do read them.

The *Variables* tab's *Extra Variables* stays empty too. `group_vars/all/private.yml` already loads from the inventory's repo (step 10), and anything put here as `--extra-vars` beats every inventory value, so a host could never override it.

### Secrets tab, Extra Variables

Add these as name and value pairs:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ansible_private_repo_token` | The real GitHub PAT from `private.yml` |
| `server_password` | The fleet's admin password |

There is no node_exporter password here. The monitoring role generates one per host, on that host, so there is no shared value to distribute. See [Setting up Node Exporter](https://github.com/myah-mitchell/docker-stacks/blob/main/containers/vmagent/stack-README.md) for how a host's own password is made and rotated.

`ansible_private_repo_token` is set here as well as in `private.yml` so the real PAT can stay out of the repo. If `private.yml` holds the real value, leave this one out.

### Where the identity values go

`provision.yml` needs four identity values: `short_name`, `abbr_name`, `location_abbr` and `domain_name`. Put them in fleet-private's `hosts.yml`, fleet-wide under `all: vars:`, and push:

```yaml
all:
  vars:
    short_name: "<short_name>"
    abbr_name: "<abbr_name>"
    location_abbr: "<location_abbr>"
    domain_name: "<domain_name>"
```

A group or a host can set its own value over the fleet-wide one. Keep the four out of the Variable Group. Semaphore passes its *Extra Variables* as `--extra-vars`, which beats every inventory value, so a host's own value would never apply.

`provision.yml` only asks for a value that neither the inventory nor `--extra-vars` sets. Semaphore has no terminal to ask on, so a missing identity value stops the run with its name in the error, and a missing `server_password` counts as empty, which leaves every password as it is. `target` is still asked for on every run, and step 12 handles it.

## 12. Create the Template

Go to *Task Templates*, click **New Template**, and choose the **Ansible Playbook** app.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `provision-monitoring` |
| *Playbook Filename* | `provision.yml` |
| *Repository* | **ansible** from step 9 |
| *Inventory* | **ansible-fleet** from step 10 |
| *Variable Groups* | **fleet-private** from step 11 |
| *Tags* | `monitoring` |

The tag is `monitoring`, not `docker`. It runs the role that installs and configures Node Exporter, which `provision.yml` tags `monitoring`.

This Template needs no `komodo_onboarding_key`. It only runs the monitoring role, on hosts that are already onboarded.

### Add target as a Survey Variable

Open the Template's *Survey Variables* tab and add one entry:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `target` |
| *Title* | **Target** |
| *Type* | **String** |
| *Required* | **Yes** |

Semaphore passes Survey Variables as `--extra-vars` too, so this suppresses the `target` prompt the same way step 11 suppresses the `server_password` one. It is a separate field because `target` changes per run.

Answer it with a host or group name from the inventory: ci01 for one host, `docker_host` for every Docker VM at once.

### Run it once against every existing host

Do this now, before moving on. km01 and ci01 were both built before this Template existed, so their Node Exporter was configured by whatever the role held on the day cloud-init ran.

The role generates each host's own random Node Exporter password on its first run and reuses it forever after, so a host that predates that behaviour still has the old committed default. Running the Template replaces it, and every host built after this one gets the right thing from cloud-init with nothing to come back for.

`docker_host` covers every Docker VM in one run.

### Create the provision-stacks Template

Create a second Template the same way, with the same `target` Survey Variable. Only these two fields differ:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | `provision-stacks` |
| *Tags* | `stacks` |

It runs the `stacks` role for every stack in the target host's `docker_stacks` list, creating the stack's folders, seeding its config files, and opening its ports. Running it again is safe. A config file already on the host is left alone, and a folder that already exists keeps its contents.

Bootstrap mode is not a Survey Variable. Semaphore passes Survey Variables as `--extra-vars`, which would override each host's own `docker_stacks_bootstrap` from step 10, so it stays in the inventory.

Run it once now with *Target* answered `ci01`, to confirm it works. Both of ci01's stacks so far were already set up from ci01 itself, so it has nothing to add.

## 13. Replace this key once step-ca is live

Once step-ca's SSH CA is running on pk01, replace the static key from step 6 with a dedicated semaphore service principal using a short-lived, auto-renewed step-ca certificate.

Do not skip this. A static private key stored in Semaphore that grants passwordless root on every host in the fleet is exactly what step-ca exists to remove.

## The OpenTofu state database

Semaphore's `tofu` runs keep their state in a second database on this same Postgres, with a role of its own that owns only that database, so Semaphore's login cannot read it. Using OpenTofu from Semaphore is optional, but the pieces that create the database are not: the `SEMAPHORE_TOFU_STATE_PASSWORD` Secret has to exist before the stack deploys, and the `postgres-initdb` folder has to hold the script.

`postgres-initdb/10-tofu-state.sh` creates the `tofu` role and the `tofu_state` database, using that Secret. The Postgres image runs it once, on the first start of an empty data directory, and never again. A fresh deployment that followed steps 1 to 3 needs nothing more.

### Adding it to an existing deployment

An existing deployment already has a data directory, so the script is skipped until that directory is emptied. If Semaphore holds nothing you need, do these in order:

1. Create the `SEMAPHORE_TOFU_STATE_PASSWORD` Secret on km01 (see the table in step 3).
2. Open `stacks/semaphore-server/komodo.env` in docker-stacks, and add its `TOFU_STATE_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` line to the Stack's *Environment* field. The field is a pasted copy, so it does not pick up repo changes by itself.
3. Run the `stacks` role against ci01, or copy the script by hand as in step 1, so `postgres-initdb/10-tofu-state.sh` exists on the host.
4. Stop the stack, empty `/opt/docker/volumes/semaphore/postgres-data`, and deploy again. This deletes everything in Semaphore's database, including its Projects, keys, and Templates, and Semaphore recreates its admin account from the environment on the next start.
5. Check that it ran: `docker logs semaphore-postgres 2>&1 | grep 10-tofu-state`.

If you do need the existing data, skip steps 3 and 4 and create the role and database by hand instead:

```bash
docker exec -it semaphore-postgres sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"'
```

```sql
CREATE ROLE tofu LOGIN;
\password tofu
CREATE DATABASE tofu_state OWNER tofu;
```

Rotating the password later is `ALTER ROLE tofu PASSWORD '...'` by hand, since the script does not run again. Put the same password in the OpenTofu Template's Environment as a secret named `PG_CONN_STR`:

```text
postgres://tofu:<password>@postgres:5432/tofu_state?sslmode=disable
```

The link is plaintext, but it never leaves ci01's `semaphore_backend` network, and OpenTofu encrypts the state itself before writing it.

The backup sidecar dumps both databases. Restore `tofu_state` on its own. Restoring the whole server from a dump rolls the state back with everything else, and an old state can make OpenTofu try to recreate VMs that exist.

## What's next

Semaphore can now reach the fleet, so a change to ansible stops being a per-host chore.

ci01 has two stacks left. [VictoriaMetrics setup](victoriametrics.md) deploys the fleet's metrics, logs, and traces backend, and [Core infrastructure setup](core-infra.md) deploys the notification and uptime services that sit alongside it.

After that, id01 is the next VM. See [Running order](../../index.md#running-order).
